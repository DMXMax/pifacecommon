Change Log
==========

v1.2
------
- Started using a change log!
- Removed errors submodule, custom exceptions now go in their respective
  modules. This might change back in a future release.
- Fixed DigitalInput value bugs
- Fixed SPI transfer bug.. Function spisend now takes bytes as an argument
  instead of a list. This makes more sense, since it returns bytes.
- Removed install.sh, everything is now handled by setup.py.
- Updated docs.
