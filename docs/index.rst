Welcome to PiFace Common's documentation!
=========================================

The pifacecommon Python3 module is required for all PiFace extensions. It
provides functions and classes for generic interfacing with the boards over
SPI.

.. note:: This module was built as a library to be used by other modules. It
   was never intended to be used by the end user. It works great for
   debugging though!
